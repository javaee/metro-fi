        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para> Japex is a simple yet powerful tool to write Java-based micro-benchmarks. It is
            similar in spirit to <link linkend="JUnit">[JUnit]</link> in that if factors out most of
            the repetitive programming logic that is necessary to write in micro-benchmarks. This
            logic includes loading and initializing multiple drivers, warming up the VM, timing the
            inner loop, etc.</para>
        <para/>
        <para> The input to Japex is an XML file describing a test suite. The output is a
            timestamped report available in both XML and HTML formats (although generation of the
            latter can be turned off). HTML reports include one or more bar charts generated using
                <link linkend="JFreeChart">[JFreeChart]</link> which graphically display the data
            for ease of comparison. </para>
        <para>In the context of this document, the term <emphasis>throughput</emphasis> is defined
            to be work over time. Japex is designed to estimate an independent throughput for each
            of the tests in the suite. Throughput estimation is done based on some parameters
            defined in the input file. There are basically two ways to specify that: (i) fix the
            amount of work and estimate time or (ii) fix the amount of time and estimate work. In
            addition to each test's individual throughput, aggregate throughtputs in the form of
            arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means are computed for each driver. </para>
        <para>Even though by default Japex will compute a per test and a per driver throughput in
                <emphasis>transactions per second</emphasis> (TPS), it is possible to customize a
            test suite to either calculate throughput using a different unit, such as KBytes/s, or
            produce a different kind of <emphasis>result</emphasis> such as latency, memory usage or
            message size.</para>

        <title>Writing Drivers</title>
        <para>A driver encapsulates knowledge about a specific algorithm implementation, and thus a
            different driver is required for each implementation under test. For example, if XML
            parsing is the algorithm under test and parsers X, Y and Z are being evaluated, a
            different driver must be provided for each implementation. </para>
        <para> A driver is a Java class that extends <token>JapexDriverBase</token>, which in turn
            implements the interface <token>JapexDriver</token> shown below. <example>
                <title>JapexDriver Interface</title>
                <programlisting><![CDATA[    public interface JapexDriver extends Runnable {
      
        public void initializeDriver();
      
        public void prepare(TestCase testCase);    
        public void warmup(TestCase testCase);
        public void run(TestCase testCase);
        public void finish(TestCase testCase);
      
        public void terminateDriver();
    } ]]>
        </programlisting>
            </example>
        </para>
        <para> The method <token>initializeDriver()</token> is called when the driver is loaded into
            memory; the method <token>terminateDriver()</token> is called when all the results for
            the driver have been computed. The other methods define the four
            <emphasis>phases</emphasis> carried out by Japex for the generation of the output
            report. </para>
        <para>The <token>prepare()</token> method defines a similarly named phase in which drivers
            set up their initial state. For example, a driver can load its input data into memory to
            avoid I/O during the subsequent two phases.</para>
        <para>The <token>warmup()</token> method is called during the warmup phase in which the
            inner loop of the computation is carried out a number of times in order to warm up the
            VM. The duration of this phase is regulated by the global parameters
            'japex.warmupIterations' and 'japex.warmupTime' (the latter taking precedence over the
            former if both are specified). </para>
        <para>The <token>run()</token> method is intended to execute the inner loop under test. For
            some drivers, this method will be identical to <token>warmup()</token>, but there are
            cases in which additional steps may be necessary during the run phase. The other
            difference is that the <token>run()</token> method will be executed concurrently
            whenever the value of the global param 'japex.numberOfThreads' is greater than one. In
            fact, the <token>run()</token> method is the only method executed concurrently, all the
            others will be called from Japex' main thread.</para>
        <para>Finally, the <token>finish()</token> method defines the last execution phase. Japex
            will set the value of the test case parameter 'japex.actualRunTime' after the run phase
            is completed but before the finish phase is started. Therefore, the
            <token>finish()</token> method can be used to override the default behavior which is to
            compute a per test throughput in TPS, where a transaction is defined to be a single call
            to <token>run()</token>. Whatever result is computed in this method must be of numeric
            type and must be used to set the output parameter 'japex.resultValue'. If the default
            result unit of TPS does not apply, the driver should also set the value of
            'japex.resultUnit' (since this unit is the same for all drivers, this parameter can also
            be set globally in Japex' input file).</para>

    <sect1>
        <title>Test Suites</title>
        <para>Test suites are described using a single configuration file written in XML. This file
            includes information such as runtime class path, drivers and test cases. A driver
            encapsulates knowledge about a specific algorithm implementation, and thus a different
            driver is required for each implementation under test. For example, if XML parsing is
            the algorithm under test and parsers X, Y and Z are being evaluated, a different driver
            must be provided for each implementation.</para>
        <para> A sample configuration file is shown below: <example>
                <title>Sample Configuration File</title>
                <programlisting><![CDATA[    <testSuite name="ParsingPerformance" xmlns="http://www.sun.com/japex/testSuite">
        <param name="libraryDir" value="lib"/>
        <param name="japex.classPath" value="${libraryDir}/../dist/classes"/>
                
        <param name="japex.warmupIterations" value="100"/>
        <param name="japex.runIterations" value="200"/>
                
        <driver name="XDriver">
            <param name="Description" value="Driver for X parser"/>
            <param name="japex.DriverClass" value="com.foo.XDriver"/>
        </driver>
        <driver name="YDriver">
            <param name="Description" value="Driver for Y parser"/>
            <param name="japex.driverClass" value="com.foo.YDriver"/>
        </driver>
        <driver name="ZDriver">
            <param name="Description" value="Driver for Z parser"/>
            <param name="japex.driverClass" value="com.foo.ZDriver"/>
        </driver>
                
        <testCase name="file1.xml">
            <param name="xmlfile" value="data/file1.xml"/>
        </testCase>
        <testCase name="file2.xml">
             <param name="xmlfile" value="data/file2.xml"/>
        </testCase>
    </testSuite>]]></programlisting>
            </example>
        </para>
        <para> A test suite's configuration file is defined as a sequence of zero or more global
            parameters followed by a sequence of one or more drivers and then followed by a sequence
            of one or more test cases. Correspondingly, there are three kinds of parameters: global,
            driver and test case paremeters. Parameters whose names start with the string "japex."
            are reserved and assigned specific meanings by Japex. For example, setting
            "japex.runIterations" to "200" will result in all test cases of the test suite to be
            executed 200 times. A list of reserved global parameters is included in Section <link
                linkend="Reference">[Reference]</link>.</para>

        <title>Normalizing Results</title>
        <para>It is often convenient to normalize all the results based on those for a specific
            driver. This is especially useful in those cases where the difference between the
            results is so large that it becomes difficult to read them from a bar chart.</para>
        <para>Defining which driver will be used as the <emphasis>normalizer</emphasis> is as simple
            as setting the <token>normal</token> attribute on the <token>driver</token> element as
            shown below: <example>
                <title>Setting the <token>normal</token> Attribute</title>
                <programlisting><![CDATA[    <testSuite name="ParsingPerformance" xmlns="http://www.sun.com/japex/testSuite">
        <param name="libraryDir" value="lib"/>                   
        ...
        <driver name="XDriver" normal="true">   <!-- Normalize results using this driver -->
            <param name="Description" value="Driver for X parser"/>
            <param name="japex.DriverClass" value="com.foo.XDriver"/>
        </driver>                    
        ...            
    </testSuite>]]></programlisting>
            </example>
        </para>
        <para>Note that the normalization of results only applies to the bar charts generated by
            Japex: the absolute values of the results are still included in the XML report and,
            consequently, in HTML report tables. The default value for <token>normal</token> is
                <token>false</token>. If more than one driver is defined as the normalizer, all but
            the first (in document order) are ignored.</para>

        <title>Parameter Values</title>
        <para> It is possible to use the syntax <token>${param_name}</token> to refer to the value
            of a parameter. If while evaluating the expression <token>${param_name}</token>, no
            parameter with that name is found, <token>param_name</token> is searched as a
            environment variable and an error is reported if no enviroment variable of that name is
            found. </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>Setting Parameters Using System Properties</title>
        <para> In order to reduce the number of configuration files, it is often desirable to
            externally define or override a global parameter. A typical example is changing the
            number of threads between runs without having to edit or duplicate a configuration file.
            This can be accomplished by using Java system properties and the <token>-D</token>
            option of the <token>java</token> command. <example>
                <title/>
                <programlisting>java -Djapex.numberOfThreads=4 com.sun.japex.Japex config.xml</programlisting>
            </example> Any system property that starts with the "japex." prefix will be set as a
            Japex global parameter provided that its value is non-empty (i.e., different from the
            empty string). Ignoring a property whose value is empty is particularly useful when
            invoking Japex via Ant. </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="Reference">
        <title>Reference</title>
        <para> Input parameters are those specified in the configuration file that defines the test
            suite. Output parameters are those that are either computed by Japex or by any of
            drivers during the execution of the test.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para> japex.numberOfThreads: Number of threads to use during the warmup and run
                        phases of the test. It is recommended to use japex.warmupTime and
                        japex.runTime whenever japex.numberOfThreads is greater than 1. If
                        iterations (i.e., work) is specified instead of time as the means to compute
                        throughput, each thread will carry out floor(iterations /
                        japex.numberOfThreads). This adjustment is necesssary to make the output of
                        a single-threaded run be comparable to that of a multi-threaded run.

                        prior to executing each test. Specified as a string in the format
                        "((HH:)?MM:)?S?S". Takes precedence over japex.warumpIterations if both are

                    <para> japex.runsPerDriver: Number of complete runs per driver. By default Japex
                        will compute a single run per driver. A run includes a result for each test
                        as well as <emphasis>horizontal</emphasis> means for the run. It is also
                        possible to compute <emphasis>vertical</emphasis> means by setting this
                        parameter to a value greater than one. The resulting output will include
                        vertical means and standard deviations for each test across all runs.
                        Moreover, the vertical means will be used to generate the output report.

                    <para> japex.includeWarmupRun: Use this parameter to compute a warmup run for
                        each driver. This is often necessary whenever the per-test warmup is not
                        enough to reach a steady state (e.g., in several client-server benchmarks).
                        Note that the output of this warmup phase will be dropped and will therefore
                        not count towards the computation of any vertical mean --and consequently
                        will not affect the output report. DEFAULT: true if japex.runsPerDriver is

                        an addition to the runtime class path. Thus, only a single class path entry
                        is allowed per definition (i.e., path separators are not allowed). It is
                        also possible for an entry in this path to end with "*.jar" to denote a set
                        of jars located in a specific directory. DEFAULT: empty, TYPE: input.</para>

                        case insensitive. May be set in the configuration file or programmatically.
                        There are number of reserved units that are understood by Japex. These are
                        "tps", "ms" and "mbps". The first, "tps" stands for Transactions Per Second
                        and is the default. The second, "ms" or Milliseconds can be used if the
                        output of the test is latency instead of throughput. Finally, "mbps" stands
                        for Megabits Per Second and must be used together with the parameter
                        japex.InputFile; i.e., Japex must know the length of the input file in order
                        to compute the number of megabits per second. If Japex is unable to
                        determine the size of the input file, and "mbps" is the value of this
                        parameter, an error will be reported. DEFAULT: "tps", TYPE:
